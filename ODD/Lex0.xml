      <p>This customization expresses the requirements defined within initiative known as TEI Lex0, initiated in December 2016 in Berlin by a group of concerned individuals gathered together by the magnetic power of Laurent Romary and Toma Tasovac. More historical and technical details will surely follow at some point.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>The text below shall be adjusted in due time. There is nothing normative about it, for now (as of September 2017).</p>
      
      <div>
        <head>Purpose</head>
        <p>To be added. Note that this customisation has been created as an extension of the work of the group focusing on the encoding of forms. It is expected and hoped that the other groups of the TEI Lex0 Task Force will join in.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Initial Changes</head>
        <p>The Dictionaries module has been imported without some of the legacy structure-building elements, such as <gi>entryFree</gi>, <gi>hom</gi> or <gi>superEntry</gi>. The named children of <gi>gramGrp</gi> are absent as well, except for <gi>gram</gi> with the obligatory <att>type</att> attribute.</p>
        <p><gi>subc</gi> (?) and <gi>colloc</gi> are likewise missing, and will be replaced by <gi>gram</gi> (?) and <gi>cit</gi>, respectively</p>
        <p>We need some Schematron here to implement the decisions of the Task Force.</p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
        <head>Basic text structure</head>
        <p>In this very simple schema, a document may contain <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi> and
            <gi>back</gi> elements as in standard TEI. However, within these, only the following
          elements are permitted: <specList>
            <specDesc key="div"/>
            <specDesc key="head"/>
            <specDesc key="list"/>
            <specDesc key="p"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>The <gi>list</gi> element may contain a <gi>head</gi> followed by a sequence either of
            <gi>label</gi>-<gi>item</gi> pairs, or of <gi>item</gi> elements alone. </p>
        <p>The <gi>item</gi> and <gi>p</gi> elements have the same structure: either may contain
          just text, or a mixture of text with <gi>list</gi>, or <gi>title</gi> elements.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the <gi>div</gi> element may contain a <gi>head</gi>, followed by a nested
            <gi>div</gi>, or one or more <gi>p</gi> elements. </p>
        <p>The <att>version</att> attribute on the <gi>TEI</gi> element is removed, as is the
            <att>level</att> attribute on the <gi>title</gi> element. Other attributes are also
          removed as a consequence of the class modifications described below.</p>
        <p>The following specification group deletes the unwanted attributes: <specGrp
            xml:id="bodyfixes">
            <elementSpec ident="title" mode="change" module="core">
              <attList>
                <attDef ident="level" mode="delete"/>
              </attList>
            </elementSpec>
            <elementSpec ident="TEI" mode="change" module="textstructure">
              <attList>
                <attDef ident="version" mode="delete"/>
              </attList>
            </elementSpec>
          </specGrp>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Header structure</head>
        <p>A much simplified version of the TEI Header is defined, again by the deletion of many
          elements. For validity, all that is required within it is the <gi>fileDesc</gi>, which
          contains only the following elements: <specList>
            <specDesc key="titleStmt"/>
            <specDesc key="publicationStmt"/>
            <specDesc key="sourceDesc"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>Within the <gi>titleStmt</gi> only a <gi>title</gi> is permitted; within the other two
          elements only a <gi>p</gi> is permitted. The <att>default</att> attribute on the
            <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element is also removed. <specGrp xml:id="hdrfixes">
            <elementSpec ident="sourceDesc" mode="change" module="header">
              <attList>
                <attDef ident="default" mode="delete"/>
              </attList>
            </elementSpec>
          </specGrp>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Class modifications</head>
        <p>Finally three of the TEI attribute classes are simplified. The attributes xml:space,
          rend, and xml:base are removed from the att.global class, so that this now makes available
          to all elements only the following attributes: <att>xml:id</att>, <att>n</att>, and
            <att>xml:lang</att>. </p>
        <p>Three un-needed attributes are removed from the att.divLike class so that the
            <gi>div</gi> element inherits from it only the following attributes: <att>xml:id</att>,
            <att>n</att>, <att>xml:lang</att>. The attribute class <ident>att.declaring</ident> is
          deleted completely, so that none of its members inherit the <att>decls</att> attribute
          defined in the unmodified TEI.</p>
        <specGrp xml:id="classmods">
          <classSpec ident="att.global" mode="change" module="tei" type="atts">
            <attList>
              <attDef ident="xml:space" mode="delete"/>

              <attDef ident="xml:base" mode="delete"/>

          </classSpec>
