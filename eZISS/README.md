These examples come from the eZISS digital library of text-critical
editions of older Slovene texts (http://nl.ijs.si/e-zrc/), where
several editions also include glossaries (small dictionaries). While
all eZISS editions are in TEI, the TEI in some cases is quite old,
while in others the glossaries were included using "general" markup,
i.e. are not modelled using the TEI dictionary elements. Through this
they can be considered "legacy dictionaries", and we do have an
interst in upgrading them to something better.

Included are two examples. Both include a short glossary / dictionary
of less understandable words, encoded using simple presentational
elements, while the second one also has interesting words grouped
together according to their domain and encoded as tables:
