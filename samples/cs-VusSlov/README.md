#Kašpar Zachariáš Vusín: Dictionarium bohemo-latino-germanicum (post 1722, ante 1742)

This example comes from the edition prepared and published by Research Infrastructure for Diachronic Czech Studies (RIDISCS, http://vokabular.ujc.cas.cz).

Edition of the Czech-Latin-German Dictionary (printed between 1722 and 1742) uses among others *original* and *regular* transcription of Czech and simple critical apparatus (notes).

Punctuation is treated as a *label* (for another language or equivalent).
