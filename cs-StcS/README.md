#Old Czech Dictionary (1968–2006)

This example comes from the edition prepared and published by Research Infrastructure for Diachronic Czech Studies (RIDISCS, http://vokabular.ujc.cas.cz).

Old Czech Dictionary (1968–2006) uses very complex apparatus for formal and semantic description of the lemma.


Electronic version of the printed Old Czech Dictionary is based on the automatic conversion from MS Word DOCX format: not all parts are fully tagged (for example examples).

There are no page breaks in the electronic version, but images of pages with related entries are available.
